        <h1>Credit Repair Tips</h1>

        <!-- Card 1 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Obtain Your Credit Reports</h2>
            <p>Request free copies of your credit reports from the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) at AnnualCreditReport.com. Review them for errors or discrepancies.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 2 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Check for Errors</h2>
            <p>Carefully examine your credit reports for inaccuracies, such as incorrect account information, late payments, or accounts that don't belong to you. Dispute any errors you find.</p>
        </div>
		<!-- Card 3 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Pay Bills on Time</h2>
            <p>Consistently pay your bills on time, as payment history is a significant factor in your credit score. Set up reminders or automatic payments to avoid late payments.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 4 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Reduce Outstanding Debt</h2>
            <p>Work on paying down your credit card balances and other outstanding debts. Aim to maintain a credit utilization ratio (credit card balance compared to the credit limit) below 30%.</p>
        </div>
		<!-- Card 5 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Create a Budget</h2>
            <p>Develop a monthly budget to track your income and expenses. This can help you manage your finances more effectively and allocate funds toward debt repayment.</p>
        </div>
		<!-- Card 6 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Prioritize High-Interest Debt</h2>
            <p>Focus on paying off high-interest debts first, as they can have a more significant impact on your finances. Consider strategies like debt snowball or debt avalanche.</p>
        </div>
		<!-- Card 7 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Avoid Opening New Credit Accounts</h2>
            <p>Limit the number of new credit accounts you open, as each new credit inquiry can temporarily lower your credit score. Only apply for credit when necessary.</p>
        </div>
		<!-- Card 8 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Use Secured Credit Cards</h2>
            <p>If you have a limited or poor credit history, consider using secured credit cards to rebuild your credit. These require a security deposit and can be a good starting point.</p>
        </div>
		<!-- Card 9 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Don't Close Old Accounts</h2>
            <p>Keep your older, positive accounts open, as they contribute to the length of your credit history, which is a factor in your credit score.</p>
        </div>
		<!-- Card 10 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Negotiate with Creditors</h2>
            <p>If you're struggling with payments, contact your creditors to discuss possible repayment plans or negotiate settlements for delinquent accounts.</p>
        </div>
		<!-- Card 11 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Seek Professional Help</h2>
            <p>If your credit situation is complex or overwhelming, consider working with a reputable credit counseling agency or credit repair service for guidance and assistance.</p>
